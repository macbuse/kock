#Inkscape extension to make Apollonian gaskets. Tested Inkscape 0.91.

The Koch snowflake  is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described.
It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled "On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometry" (original French title: Sur une courbe continue sans tangente, obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentaire)[citation needed] by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.
The progression for the area of the snowflake converges to 8/5 times the area of the original triangle,
while the progression for the snowflake's perimeter diverges to infinity.
Consequently, the snowflake has a finite area bounded by an infinitely long line.
